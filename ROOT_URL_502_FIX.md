# Fix Root URL 502 Error

## 🚨 **Issue:**
```
GET / 502 159ms
GET / 502 161ms
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis:**

### **Health Check vs Root URL**
- ✅ **Health check works** - `/health/` returns 200 OK
- ❌ **Root URL fails** - `/` returns 502 Bad Gateway
- **Problem**: Different behavior between health check and root URL serving

### **Possible Causes:**
1. **React app not found** - `index.html` not in correct location
2. **File serving error** - Django can't serve the React files
3. **Path mismatch** - STATIC_ROOT path incorrect
4. **Permission issues** - Can't read React build files

## ✅ **Debugging Solution Applied:**

### **1. Enhanced Root View with Debug Logging**
- Added detailed logging to see exactly what's happening
- Shows file paths, existence checks, and error details
- Multiple fallback layers with error reporting

### **2. React File Verification**
- Added verification step after copying React build
- Lists contents of staticfiles directory
- Confirms `index.html` exists before Django tries to serve it

### **3. Better Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback from React → Django template → JSON
- Each step logs what it's trying and why it fails
- Debug information in JSON response

## 🚀 **Expected Results:**

After redeployment, you should see in the logs:
- ✅ **React file verification** - Confirms `index.html` was copied
- ✅ **Debug logging** - Shows exactly what Django is trying to serve
- ✅ **Root URL working** - Either React app or fallback template

## 📋 **Files Updated:**

- ✅ `e2i/backend/e2i_api/urls.py` - Added debug logging to root view
- ✅ `start.sh` - Added React file verification step

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Commit and push the debugging changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add debug logging to diagnose root URL 502 error"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Check Railway logs** for debug output:
   - React file verification results
   - Django root view debug messages
   - File path and existence information

3. **Identify the exact issue** from the debug logs

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

In the Railway logs, you should see:
- `🔍 Looking for React app at: /path/to/index.html`
- `🔍 File exists: true/false`
- `✅ React index.html found` or `❌ React index.html NOT found`

This will tell us exactly why the root URL is failing! 🕵️‍♂️
