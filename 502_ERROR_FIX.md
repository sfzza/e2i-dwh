# Fix 502 Bad Gateway Error

## 🚨 **Issue**: 502 Bad Gateway - Application failed to respond

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

Your Django backend is starting successfully, but there's a **port configuration issue**:

- ✅ Django starts on port 3000
- ❌ Railway expects the app to respond on the PORT environment variable
- ❌ This creates a mismatch causing 502 errors

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

I've updated your configuration to fix this:

### **1. Updated `start.sh`**
- Added Railway environment debugging
- Added Gunicorn production server support
- Better port handling

### **2. Updated `requirements.txt`**
- Added Gunicorn for production deployment

### **3. Port Configuration**
- Django will now use Railway's PORT variable correctly
- Fallback to development server if Gunicorn unavailable

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Redeploy Your Backend**
1. Go to your **backend Railway project**
2. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click **"Redeploy"** or **"Deploy Latest"**
4. Wait for build to complete

### **Step 2: Check the Logs**
Look for these success indicators:
```
🔍 Railway Environment Debug:
PORT: [some number]
🚀 Starting with Gunicorn (Production)
[INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.x.x
[INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:[PORT] ([PID])
```

### **Step 3: Verify the Fix**
- ✅ No more 502 errors
- ✅ Backend responds to requests
- ✅ API endpoints accessible

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After redeployment, you should see:
- ✅ Backend starts with Gunicorn
- ✅ Correct port binding
- ✅ No 502 errors
- ✅ API accessible at your Railway URL

## 📋 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Still Getting 502:**
1. Check Railway logs for startup errors
2. Verify PORT environment variable is set
3. Ensure Gunicorn installs successfully

### **If Gunicorn Fails:**
The script will fallback to Django development server automatically.

## 🔍 **Environment Variables Check**

Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `PORT` (automatically set by Railway)
- `DATABASE_URL` (from PostgreSQL addon)
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`

The 502 error should be resolved after redeployment! 🎉
