# Fix 502 Error - Railway Port Configuration

## 🚨 **Current Status:**
- ✅ Gunicorn starts successfully
- ✅ Listening on port 3000
- ✅ 3 workers running
- ❌ Railway still shows 502 errors

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
Railway might be expecting your app to respond on a different port or there's a routing configuration issue.

## 🔧 **Solution Steps:**

### **Step 1: Check Railway Project Settings**
1. Go to your **Railway project dashboard**
2. Click on your **service**
3. Go to **"Settings"** tab
4. Check **"Port"** setting - it should be `3000` or `$PORT`
5. If it's set to a specific number, change it to `$PORT`

### **Step 2: Add Environment Variable**
In Railway project settings, add:
```
PORT=3000
```

### **Step 3: Alternative - Use Railway's Auto Port**
If the above doesn't work, let Railway assign the port automatically:
1. Remove any manual PORT setting
2. Let Railway set it automatically
3. Redeploy

### **Step 4: Check Railway Logs**
Look for any errors like:
- Port binding issues
- Health check failures
- Routing problems

## 🎯 **Expected Fix:**
After applying these changes, your API should respond correctly at:
`https://e2i-dwh-production.up.railway.app`

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working:**
Try this alternative approach:

1. **Delete current deployment**
2. **Create new Railway project**
3. **Use these settings:**
   - Builder: `Dockerfile`
   - Root Directory: `/` (root)
   - Port: `$PORT` (auto)
   - Environment Variables: Add `PORT=3000`

The 502 error should resolve once Railway properly routes traffic to your Gunicorn server! 🎉
